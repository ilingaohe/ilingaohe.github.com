<p>This sample implements a two different view controllers one for portrait and one for landscape. The portrait view controller listens for device orientations in order to properly swap in and out the landscape view controller. It uses the above two properties to achieve the visual cross-fade effect.</p>
<hr />
<h4 id='appprefs'><a href='http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#samplecode/AppPrefs/Introduction/Intro.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/DTS40007799'>AppPrefs</a></h4>

<p>Demonstrates how to display your app&#8217;s preferences or settings in the &#8220;Settings&#8221; system application. A settings bundle, included in your application’s bundle directory, contains the information needed by the Settings application to display your preferences and make it possible for the user to modify them. It then saves any configured values in the defaults database so that your application can retrieve them at runtime.</p>

<p>This sample also shows how to dynamically update it&#8217;s UI when its settings are changed while the app is in the background via &#8220;NSUserDefaultsDidChangeNotification&#8221;.</p>

<p>This sample offers an Xcode project already pre-configured to build your Settings bundle as a target. To customize your settings UI, change the Root.plist file.</p>

<p>This application illustrates the fundamentals of browsing for network services using Bonjour. The BonjourBrowser hierarchically displays Bonjour domains and services as table views in a navigation controller. The contents of the table views are discovered and updated dynamically using NSNetServiceBrowser objects. Tapping an item in the services table causes the corresponding NSNetService object to be resolved asynchronously. When that resolution completes, a delegate method is called which constructs a URL and opens it in Safari.</p>
<hr />
<h4 id='breadcrumb'><a href='http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#samplecode/Breadcrumb/Introduction/Intro.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/DTS40010048'>Breadcrumb</a></h4>

<p>Demonstrates basic use of MapKit, displaying a map view and setting its region to current location.</p>

<p>It makes use of the MKReverseGeocoder class that provides services for converting your map coordinate (specified as a latitude/longitude pair) into information about that coordinate, such as the country, city, or street. A reverse geocoder object is a single-shot object that works with a network-based map service to look up placemark information for its specified coordinate value. To use placemark information is leverages the MKPlacemark class to store this information.</p>
<hr />
<h4 id='datecell'><a href='http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#samplecode/DateCell/Introduction/Intro.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/DTS40008866'>DateCell</a></h4>

<p>Demonstrates formatted display of date objects in UITableViewCells and use of UIDatePicker to edit those values.</p>

<p>Using a grouped style UITableViewController, the sample has two UITableViewCells to draw the primary title and NSDate value. This is accomplished using the built-in cell type &#8220;UITableViewCellStyleValue1&#8221; which supports left and right text. In addition, this sample shows how to use NSDateFormatter class to achieve the custom cell&#8217;s date-formatted appearance.</p>
<hr />
<h4 id='datesectiontitles'><a href='http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#samplecode/DateSectionTitles/Introduction/Intro.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/DTS40009939'>DateSectionTitles</a></h4>

<p>This application shows how to create section information for NSFetchedResultsController using dates.</p>

<p>A single table view controller displays events sorted by date and grouped into sections by year and month. The Event entity has three attributes:</p>

<ul>
<li>timeStamp (persistent NSDate object).</li>
</ul>

<p>The time stamp represents the time the event occurred.</p>

<ul>
<li>title (persistent NSString object).</li>
</ul>

<p>The title of each event as it will be displayed on a row in the table view (this is not to be confused with section title). When the default data is created in the application delegate, the title is initialized to a string representation of the date.</p>

<ul>
<li>sectionIdentifier (transient NSString object).</li>
</ul>

<p>The sectionIdentifier is used to divide the events into sections in the table view. It is a string value representing the number ((year * 1000) + month). Using this value, events can be correctly ordered chronologically regardless of the actual name of the month. It is calculated and cached on demand in the custom accessor method.</p>

<p>The sorting is all done at fetch time by the fetched results controller. The section name transformations are UI level and have no effect on the order of data.</p>
<hr />
<h4 id='docinteraction'><a href='http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#samplecode/DocInteraction/Introduction/Intro.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/DTS40010052'>DocInteraction</a></h4>

<p>Demonstrates how to use UIDocumentInteractionController to obtain information about documents and how to preview them. There are two ways to preview documents: one is to use UIDocumentInteractionController&#8217;s preview API, the other is directly use QLPreviewController. This sample also demonstrates the use of UIFileSharingEnabled feature so you can upload documents to the application using iTunes and then to preview them. With the help of &#8220;kqueue&#8221; kernel event notifications, the sample monitors the contents of the Documents folder.</p>
<hr />
<h4 id='drilldownsave'><a href='http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#samplecode/DrillDownSave/Introduction/Intro.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/DTS40007800'>DrillDownSave</a></h4>

<p>Demonstrates how to restore the user&#8217;s current location in a drill-down list style user interface and restore that location when the app is relaunched. The drill-down or content hierarchy is generated from a plist file called &#8216;outline.plist&#8217;. The sample stores the user&#8217;s location in its preferences file using NSUserDefaults.</p>
<hr />
<h4 id='eademo'><a href='http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#samplecode/EADemo/Introduction/Intro.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/DTS40010079'>EADemo</a></h4>

<h4 id='fastenumerationsample'><a href='http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#samplecode/FastEnumerationSample/Introduction/Intro.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/DTS40009411'>FastEnumerationSample</a></h4>

<p>A Mac OS X command line project that demonstrates how to implement the NSFastEnumeration protocol. In this sample the MyFastEnumerationSample class implements -countByEnumeratingWithState:objects:count: to return strings on demand. This sample avoids considering how you may implement a storage class, whereas a real implementation would likely need to do less work to provide values, such as directly copying object pointers from an internal representation. Regardless of your class&#8217;s actual implementation, adopting the NSFastEnumeration protocol also allows you to use the for&#8230;in syntax to access your containers objects.</p>
<hr />
<h4 id='formulaic'><a href='http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#samplecode/Formulaic/Introduction/Intro.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/DTS40008932'>Formulaic</a></h4>

<p>Formulaic is a sample iPhone app that illustrates how to effectively use the iPhone Accessibility API. Using the Accessibility API allows your app to work correctly with VoiceOver.</p>

<p>The app draws a graph of a formula and allows the user to change certain constants in the formula, however its main purpose is to illustrate the iPhone Accessibility API.</p>
<hr />
